# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive backend Content Management System (CMS) for the Text Machine Lab website using Spring Boot framework with MVC architecture pattern, PostgreSQL database, user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control. The system will support two user roles (Admin and Co-Admin) with different permission levels for managing website content including projects, publications, events, blog posts, and user management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to authenticate and manage user accounts, so that I can control access to the CMS system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using secure credentials
2. WHEN an Admin accesses user management THEN the system SHALL allow creating new Admin and Co-Admin accounts
3. WHEN an Admin creates a user THEN the system SHALL require username, email, password, and role assignment
4. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL allow updating user information and deactivating accounts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Co-Admin, I want to authenticate and manage content, so that I can maintain website information without full administrative privileges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Co-Admin logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate and provide content management access
2. WHEN a Co-Admin accesses user management THEN the system SHALL NOT allow creating new Co-Admin or Admin accounts
3. WHEN a Co-Admin manages content THEN the system SHALL allow full CRUD operations on projects, publications, events, and blog posts
4. WHEN a Co-Admin attempts restricted actions THEN the system SHALL deny access and show appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a PostgreSQL database schema that reflects the existing website content, so that all current data can be properly stored and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the database THEN the system SHALL have tables for users, projects, publications, events, blog posts, and categories
2. WHEN storing project data THEN the system SHALL capture title, description, image, tags, categories, and external links
3. WHEN storing publication data THEN the system SHALL capture authors, title, venue, year, PDF links, and BibTeX data
4. WHEN storing event data THEN the system SHALL capture title, description, image, categories, dates, and external links

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Admin or Co-Admin, I want to manage projects through the CMS, so that I can maintain the research project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL require title, description, and allow optional image, tags, categories, and external links
2. WHEN updating a project THEN the system SHALL validate all fields and maintain data integrity
3. WHEN deleting a project THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and handle related data appropriately
4. WHEN viewing projects THEN the system SHALL display all projects with filtering and search capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Admin or Co-Admin, I want to manage publications through the CMS, so that I can maintain academic publication records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a publication THEN the system SHALL require authors, title, venue, year, and allow optional PDF and BibTeX links
2. WHEN managing publications THEN the system SHALL support multiple authors and proper citation formatting
3. WHEN displaying publications THEN the system SHALL show clean formatting without document icons
4. WHEN exporting publications THEN the system SHALL provide BibTeX and other academic formats

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Admin or Co-Admin, I want to manage events through the CMS, so that I can maintain workshop and conference information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an event THEN the system SHALL require title, description, date, and allow optional image, categories, and external links
2. WHEN managing events THEN the system SHALL support event categorization and filtering
3. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show events in chronological order with proper formatting
4. WHEN archiving events THEN the system SHALL maintain historical records while marking them as past events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an Admin or Co-Admin, I want to manage blog posts through the CMS, so that I can maintain the research blog content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a blog post THEN the system SHALL require title, content, author, and publication date
2. WHEN managing blog posts THEN the system SHALL support rich text editing and image uploads
3. WHEN publishing blog posts THEN the system SHALL allow draft, published, and archived states
4. WHEN displaying blog posts THEN the system SHALL show posts with proper formatting and author attribution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Spring Boot backend following MVC architecture, so that the system is maintainable and follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL use Spring Boot framework with proper MVC structure
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Models into distinct layers
3. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL follow Spring Boot conventions and dependency injection
4. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL use Spring Boot configuration management and profiles

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure REST API endpoints for all CMS operations, so that the frontend can interact with the backend safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication tokens
2. WHEN performing role-restricted operations THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions using Spring Security
3. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL validate input data and return appropriate JSON responses
4. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages and proper HTTP status codes
