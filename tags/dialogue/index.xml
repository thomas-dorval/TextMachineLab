      <description>This study presents a recurrent neural network model to automate the analysis of students&amp;rsquo; computational thinking in problem-solving dialogue. We have collected and annotated dialogue transcripts from middle school students solving a robotics challenge, and each dialogue turn is assigned a code.
We use sentence embeddings and speaker identities as features, and experiment with linear chain CRFs and RNNs with a CRF layer (LSTM-CRF). Both the linear chain CRF model and the LSTM-CRF model outperform the naive baselines by a large margin, and LSTM-CRF has an edge between the two.</description>
